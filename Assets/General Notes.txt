---- RPC vs Raise Events ----

RPC
- call to end go, this is checked for 'amHost'. if not host, forget about it. If am host, start the logic behind ending turns.
  after the logic is finished, send out an RPC to set the turn to be something across the board.

Raise Event
- call out to send message via lobby. After receiving, then read the message and display as being said by the specific guy


---- PLAN ----

Rough Go-Through of an Online Game:
- All players join into a lobby and 'ready up'
- A grid is generated and shared across the network
- All players are instantiated on the grid
- Player 0 goes first, all others have no functionality
- After finishing the game, the player's scores are displayed.
- All players are returned to the lobby together
-

What is sent to the network during the lobby:
- Name change calls for each player
- Ready calls for each player
- Drop out calls for each player
-

What is sent to the network during init of the game innit:
- each player's feller's names
- The grid, in the form of a bool[gridwidth * gridlength]
- each player's feller's randomised positions
- 

What is sent to the network during the game:
- whose turn and go it is
- end go call of current player
- the movement calls, attack calls and """animation""" calls of all fellers
- Damage, health and mortality of the fellers
- UI calls
- Whether or not all players are present (potential for somebody to drop out). Dropping out instantly kills their feller and sets their score to -9999. (0 dd / 9999 hl)
-

---- BETTER PLAN ----

1. Two guys, chilling in a grid, two gridbits apart cause they're not gay.
2. NO CLIENT_METASTATS WHERE POSSIBLE
3. No grid generation. Pulling the same sneaky trick I did with the save system. No holes. All grid. Set size.

---- GOALS ----

1 - Players are able to show up in a lobby together, able to change name
2 - Players are able to agree on a grid
3 - Players are able to load into a grid on randomised positions that are synced
4 - Players are able to move around on the grid
5 - Players are able to attack
6 - Players are able to die
7 - The final score is calculated and displayed to all players
8 - Players are able to return to the lobby

The maybe territory

9 - a visual of a crown is placed on the player name that won last round
