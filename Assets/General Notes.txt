---- PLAN ----

Rough Go-Through of an Online Game:
- All players join into a lobby and 'ready up'
- A grid is generated and shared across the network
- All players are instantiated on the grid
- Player 0 goes first, all others have no functionality
- After finishing the game, the player's scores are displayed.
- All players are returned to the lobby together
-

What is sent to the network during the lobby:
- Name change calls for each player
- Ready calls for each player
- Drop out calls for each player
-

What is sent to the network during init of the game innit:
- each player's feller's names
- The grid, in the form of a bool[gridwidth * gridlength]
- each player's feller's randomised positions
- 

What is sent to the network during the game:
- whose turn and go it is
- end go call of current player
- the movement calls, attack calls and """animation""" calls of all fellers
- Damage, health and mortality of the fellers
- UI calls
- Whether or not all players are present (potential for somebody to drop out). Dropping out instantly kills their feller and sets their score to -9999. (0 dd / 9999 hl)

All of plan works
