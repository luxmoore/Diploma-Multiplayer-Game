Change Notes:


-----------

Immediate Goals and Suggestions:
! Could change the pathfinding algorithm to stop checking after the energy limit is reached. (Less checks on grid step update, which happens often)
! Display player names above/around the players. Also something to show what player is being controlled.

Current Known Issues:
! For some reason, there is an extra step when attempting to move a player diagonally D+L. This exclusively happens when the first selection is D+L from the player.
! Players may be unable to reach eachother by placement on the grid thanks to generation not accounting for player to player accessability
