Current Version: 0.3.2

-----------

Change Notes:

+ Players are now able to attack eachother and deal damage
+ On killing, the pathfinding algorithm re-evaulates the grid
+ The player's total damage and total health lost are updated by the game
+ Added the start for the end game scenario

-----------

Immediate Goals and Suggestions:
! Could change the pathfinding algorithm to stop checking after the energy limit is reached. (Less checks on grid step update, which happens often)
! Display player names above/around the players. Also something to show what player is being controlled.

Current Known Issues:
! For some reason, there is an extra step when attempting to move a player diagonally D+L. This exclusively happens when the first selection is D+L from the player.
! Players may be unable to reach eachother by placement on the grid
