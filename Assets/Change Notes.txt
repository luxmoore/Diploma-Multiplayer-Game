Current Version: 0.3.2

-----------

Change Notes:

+ Changed the pathfinding algorithm to both include a check for if there is somebody there 
+ The 'LUX_Grid' script now will also acknowledge when somebody is on a gridbit. This is essential for interplayer interaction.
+ Dramatically increased the amount of information in my change notes, since thats the only place I constantly update each time.
+ The player is now actually limited by their energy
+ The UI updates as the player moves to show the current energy count of the player

-----------

Immediate Goals and Suggestions:
! Could change the pathfinding algorithm to stop checking after the energy limit is reached. (Less checks on grid step update, which happens often)
! Display player names above/around the players. Also something to show what player is being controlled.

Current Known Issues:
! For some reason, there is an extra step when attempting to move a player diagonally D+L. This exclusively happens when the first selection is D+L from the player.
