Current Version: 0.5.3

Change Notes:

! Name changing is done through the save system.
+ Fixed a bug that didn't allow for the first person in a match to move
+ The health UI now shows properly.
+ Created a help menu that is only accessible from the game loop
+ Fixed the D+L movement bug with Dan's help (it was returning an false negative in the diagonal check for one of the monodirections)
+ Fixed main menu UI

Immediate Goals and Suggestions:
!!!!! SAVE SYSTEM RIGHT FUCKING NOW YOU HAVE THREE DAYS YOU TROGLODYTE GET THAT SHIT OPERATIONAL !!!!!!
!!!!! Animate the balls (add particle effects on hit with a bit of squash and stretch) (required) (lol balls) !!!!!
! Could change the pathfinding algorithm to stop checking after the energy limit is reached. (Less checks on grid step update, which happens often)
! Display what player is being controlled.
! Display where a player can move to using the canvases already set up

Current Known Issues Bounty Board:
- Sometimes the UI for energy doesn't update properly
- Players may be unable to reach eachother by placement on the grid thanks to generation not accounting for player to player accessability
- Score isn't counting damage that result in kills properly (works well enough to score each player i guess)
- Sometimes the first player in a new game will not be given any pathing. This is because of line 52 in 'GameController.cs' not updating when finishing on a non-0 player.
