Current Version: 0.4.1

-----------

Change Notes:

+ Added variables to the MetaStats.cs for post gamestart initialization
+ Added menu scenes folder with the main menu and lobby scenes. These were added to the build.
! The sample scene is now the main game thing. Also there is only a max of three players currently.
$$$ well that was fucking easy
+ Added full menu functionality. Heres to the 'Crunch' passive perk we all get when we develop games. Not sure I should've made my build around it but it is what it is.

-----------

Immediate Goals and Suggestions:
! Could change the pathfinding algorithm to stop checking after the energy limit is reached. (Less checks on grid step update, which happens often)
!! Display player names above/around the players. Also something to show what player is being controlled.

Current Known Issues:
! For some reason, there is an extra step when attempting to move a player diagonally D+L. This exclusively happens when the first selection is D+L from the player.
! Players may be unable to reach eachother by placement on the grid thanks to generation not accounting for player to player accessability
