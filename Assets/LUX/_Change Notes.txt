Current Version: 0.0.5

- Changed (gutted functionality from) the gamecontroller script as to not handle the turn system. It now acts more as a overarching thing.
+ Added the 'LUX_TurnSystem' to fill this void.
+ Added some more commentation onto the 'GridBehaviour' script
- Removed unused and entirely unneccessary script 'DEBUGButtons'
> Moved all scripts used purely for reference against into their own section. (A folder called 'For Referencing'). Scripts 'GridBehaviour' and 'GridStats' have been moved here.
+ Ported in my AI from last semester, 'CleanerAI', into the referencing folder. This is mainly for understanding the usage of coroutines.
+ Added a text file that shows what has changed since last update. (This is a rage-add after my computer crashed and github didn't save my description for the thinger.)
+ Blocked out the scenes I want in the final game. ('GameLoop', 'Lobby', 'Main Menu')
+ Added the 'LUX_GridBit' script to hold information about the particular gridbit gameobject. Added this to the prefab.
+ Added script 'LUX_PathFollower' and set up to recieve information. Functionality in a later update.
+ Script 'LUX_Grid' can now set a path out via the 'Visited' variable from a particular point on the grid. Currently 60% functional.
